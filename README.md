Proposal: create a fraudulent ads detector

User journey:

Imagine a person named Mario trying to rent an apartment in Seattle. He finds an amazing affordable place in Seattle Downtown, emails the owner and recieved a response saying that as there are several other people interested in the property, Mario has to wire the deposit to a XXXXX bank account as soon as possible.

Mario realises it is a scam, but he wished the website flagged scamm ads, so he wouldn't waste time, or be in danger og getting scammed.

But there is this app where he can input ad parameters (text, price, location, etc.), and he the website outputs the probability of it to be a scam, so Mario can be cautious about his further interactions with the ad owner.

So when he finds another property he likes, he goes to the website www.fightthescammers.com, copies ad text, introduces other parameters and get's back: "Probability of it to be a scam is 99%. DANGER!"

He then drops the idea to rent this property and keeps searching.
